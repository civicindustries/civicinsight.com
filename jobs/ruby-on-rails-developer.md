#### Seeking a Ruby-on-Rails Developer
We are seeking a *Ruby on Rails Developer* to help streamline and improve our platform. Weâ€™re looking for a team player whoâ€™s eager to get their hands dirty working on a multi-tenant Rails application with lots of data.



### Your Challenges:

  * Our clients have millions of rows of data. Are you excited by the prospect of scaling from 10 cities to 100 of cities?
  
  * Our clients provide us with years of data about the past. Do you think you can predict the future?
  
  * Clients often structure their data in slightly different formats. With no custom code, do you think you can design a system that is smart enough to handle the differences?

  * Our dashboard generates reports and visualizations in real-time. What would you need to consider to ensure the user experience is responsive?
  
  * Put yourself in this situation: The search interface is running errors. Is it the database? Is it Heroku? Did the API go down? Memcache? Rails? or is it a bug in Ruby? When a situation like this occurs, do you feel comfortable trying to figure out what went wrong?
  
    
  
  

### How we work
  * We practice agile development with continuous intergration. We value getting from idea to production quickly.

  * We are located in the Bay Area, but mostly work remotely. We respect and trust each other to manage our own time effectively and enjoy the benefits of a results-only work environment.

  * We value diversity and encourage candidates of any gender identity or expression, race, ethnicity, age, size, sexual orientation, religion and identity to apply.
