### About the internship:

  * Spend 10 hours a week, for a minimum of 3 months, leading one or more projects in line with your area of interest.

  * Gain access to an unprecedented network of industry and civic leaders, and have a direct influence on the future of a product that’s solving real civic problems.

  * Earn stipend, commensurate with experience. Alternatively, we can provide school credit if that works better for you.  


### Projects:

  * *Social media strategy:* Help generate and maintain our social media presence across multiple platforms. Help expand our visibility online and measure the impact of your posts.

  * *Community outreach:* Work with our government and non-profit partners to develop outreach strategies to help their residents discover and use Civic Insight.

  * *Growth hacking:* Leverage tactics and tools like search engine optimization, A/B testing, and website analytics to help potential users and customers discover our platform online.

  * *Media relations:* help draft press releases, coordinate with media contacts and outlets, and help publicize customer launches.


### About you:

  * You’re a current student or recent graduate with experience in marketing, communication, or a related field (whether through your studies, extracurriculars, or work experience).

  * You are driven, inquisitive, and entrepreneurial; communicate effectively; and care deeply about civic life and how technology can enhance it.

  * You have strong writing and research skills and are exciting about creating original content that you can point to after your internship and say “I did that”.

  * You’re web-savvy, and fluent in social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and AngelList.

  * You know your way around Google Apps (Docs, Sheets, Forms); bonus points for familiarity with MailChimp.

  * You’re able to work independently and can thrive in a fast-paced, rapidly changing startup environment.
