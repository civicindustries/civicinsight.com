#### About Us
At Civic Insight, we are building an online platform that makes large amounts of official data about buildings, permits, code enforcement and construction available to city staff and the public in a refreshingly simple interface. We have seen how lack of access to this information can be costly to businesses, governments and communities, and we’re working to change that.

We’ve graduated from [Code for America’s Incubator](http://codeforamerica.org/geeks/incubator-faq/), we have [investments from the Knight Foundation](http://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/20102537/), and we’re generating consistent revenue. Our platform has garnered praise from [PBS News Hour](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/a-high-tech-solution-for-a-neighborhood-problem/), [Time Magazine](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2140202,00.html), and [the Wall Street Journal](http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2012/12/04/the-big-easy-hopes-technology-will-solve-hard-recovery-issues/).

This is where you come in!
