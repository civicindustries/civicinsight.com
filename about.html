  <p>Civic Insight makes real-time government data about a community’s underutilized spaces – think abandoned homes, empty storefronts, or vacant lots – both publicly available and extremely easy to use and understand. By getting everyone on the same page, Civic Insight makes it easier for government staff, motivated citizens, and local organizations to collaborate more effectively to improve the quality and value of their neighborhoods.</p>
